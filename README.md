# side-projects
Place to upload any non college side-work I do.
Current work:
  - Sentence Length -> Reads in a text file and spits some out some stats about it. WIP
  - Sudoku Solver -> Uses backtracking to quickly solve Sudoku puzzles.
  - Node Mapping -> Reads in a text file and draws nodes and connecting edges. Can calculate the shortest path from a point to 
    any other connected point on the map. WIP
